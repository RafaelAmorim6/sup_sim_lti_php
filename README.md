Super Simple LTI Provider in PHP
===============

Super simple implementation of an LTI provider in PHP.

Clone the code to your system and you're ready to go.

You'll need to point an LTI consumer at this tool to see any output.

Based on Dr .Chuck Severance's PHP providers examples (http://www.dr-chuck.com/csev-blog/)

LTI spec and dev info can be found at http://developers.imsglobal.org/
